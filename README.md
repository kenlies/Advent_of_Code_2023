# Advent_of_Code_2023

My solutions for AoC 2023

Done in C++

As the name suggests, we get a new set of coding problems every day as the advent of that day. There is part 1 and part 2 for each day. I tried to complete both parts, but as we approached the holidays, some of the part 2's took way too much time to get done. As such, some days only include part 1. 

If you are interested in the problems, I believe AoC keeps the problems for each year up, so a quick google search should be enough.

I did this to get more familiar with C++ & problems related to coding.
